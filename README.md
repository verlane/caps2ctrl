1. For Remote Desktop Client(Alt+Tab, Win key)
2. "Caps Lock" to "Ctrl"
3. "Caps Lock" to "Ctrl" for RDC
4. "Caps Lock" to "Ctrl" and "Ctrl" to "Numpad Multiply"

7. "Caps Lock" to "Ctrl" and "Ctrl" to "Numpad Multiply" and "Win" to "Alt" and "Alt" to "Numpad Divide" for RDC

This software uses 'User installable keymap' (Android 4.1 and up).
Therefore, it can not be used on an Android device whose manufacturer disabled "Settings" -> "Languages & input" -> "Physical keyboard" of Android settings.
