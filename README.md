# caps2ctrl
This application adds a keyboard layout (English, US, qwerty) which changed for the physical keyboard below:

1. "Caps Lock" to "Ctrl"
1. "Caps Lock" to "Ctrl" and "Ctrl" to "Numpad Multiply" 
1. "Caps Lock" to "Ctrl" for Remote Desktop Client(Alt+Tab, Win key)
1. "Caps Lock" to "Ctrl" and "Ctrl" to "Numpad Multiply" for Remote Desktop Client(Alt+Tab, Win key)

This software uses 'User installable keymap' (Android 4.1 and up).
Therefore, it can not be used on an Android device whose manufacturer disabled "Settings" -> "Languages & input" -> "Physical keyboard" of Android settings.
